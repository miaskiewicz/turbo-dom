# Native DOM string code units

The additive `*_utf16` and `*_units` methods keep original UTF-16 units in the
native Tree. Text, comments, processing-instruction data, attributes, element
names, namespaces and doctype fields distinguish lone high surrogates, lone low
surrogates and U+FFFD. Normal scalar strings retain compact storage; a non-scalar
payload owns its original unit buffer. Existing `&str`/`String` getters and
`AttributeData` remain compatibility views. Bindings that require DOM string
behavior must use the unit getters and `AttributeDataUtf16`.

Mutation drains expose exact old values, local names and namespaces through
`Utf16MutationEvent`. Import/clone/adoption can use the complete unit attribute
records and name/namespace methods. Collection charges unit payloads, identity
keys and pending mutation buffers before committing; failure leaves the Tree
unchanged and handles are never reused.

`Tree::parse_utf16`, `set_inner_html_utf16` and `insert_adjacent_html_utf16` accept
DOM string units. Scalar inputs without U+FEFF use the existing parser. Inputs
with lone units or U+FEFF use the license-preserved html5ever 0.39 tokenizer adaptation and its
public tree builder. A temporary scalar escape transport doubles literal markers
and decoded numeric marker references; lone-unit encodings are injective and
cannot alias source markers or numeric entities. Native nodes immediately decode
this transport into native unit-backed payloads. It is never exposed to guest JS.
The parser retains grammar, rawtext/RCDATA, foreign-content and foster-parenting
behavior, preserves template-content fragments, and retains U+FEFF wherever
it appears in a DOM string. The adaptation preserves upstream tokenizer tests
and source hashes. Parser projection/import, text aggregation and serialization
use explicit heap stacks; deep trees do not consume the host call stack.

Original-unit selector entry points parse into native records without caching
under lossy strings. CSS identifiers and hexadecimal surrogate escapes use
replacement-character behavior; raw quoted attribute strings keep original units.
Scalar selectors retain the existing bounded caches. Structural type comparisons
and ID lookup also distinguish original names and values.

Chrome controls cover these DOM seams. They do not establish complete browser
API parity, XML parsing, resource lifecycles or JavaScript engine/source behavior.
Those are consumer capabilities and must be tested in the consuming runtime.
